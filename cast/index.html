            One was originally Derrick Moss, CEO of CoreLactic Industries. When
            Three (pre-amnesia) murdered his wife, he got plastic surgery and
            assumed the identity of criminal named Jace Corso to gain passage on
            the Raza to kill Three.

            Two is an advanced biosynthetic organism, manufactured by Dwarf Star
            Technologies. She is a max of human and artificial parts with
            corrective nanites that give her advanced healing abilities. She's
            something of an illegal prototype - if the authorites ever
            discovered her existence, it's likely she would be hunted down and
            destroyed.

            At some point before the crew's memories were wiped, she absorbed
            all their memories. This resulted in having flashes of memory from
            the pre-amnesia days, but she doesn't know whose they are (including
            if they are her own).<br />Pre-amnesia, she was a homeless teenager
            who snuck onboard the Raza to get medical supplies. She was caught
            by a pre-amnesia Three and locked up.
